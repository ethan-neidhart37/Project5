Knapsack: Steepest Descent and Tabu Search
With the use of steepest descent on knapsack, we first sort the set of items, create a new neighbor of items found greedily, 
then we compare which of the pair of neighbors have the best value when solving the knapsack problem. The results are accurate.
But as soon as we got to knapsack1024, it took about 4 minutes to compare each of these neighbors and provide accurate results.
For tabu search, we've gotten the same results as our steepest descent implementation. But at knapsack1024, it seems that tabu
solved knapsack very slighty quicker than steepest descent. These algorithms were solved faster than exhaustive and provided
accurate results. Compared to greedy and branch/bound, it solved a bit slower because of the added complexity or sorting and 
comparing neighbors, but results are more accurate. Lastly, we see ILP is still the best method in terms of speed and accuracy.
